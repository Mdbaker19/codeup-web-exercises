You have rented some movies for your kids: The little mermaid (for 3 days), Brother Bear (for 5 days, they love it), and Hercules (1 day, you don't know yet if they're going to like it). If price for a movie per day is $3, how much will you have to pay?
function sum(x, y) {
	return x + y;

}
function getTotal(array) {
	var newArray = array.map((element) => element *= 3);
	return newArray.reduce(sum);
}

//Different solution ??? which would work in a given situation???
function movieTotal(x, y, z) {
	return ((x * 3) + (y * 3) + (z * 3));
}

Suppose you're working as a contractor for 3 companies: Google, Amazon and Facebook, they pay you a different rate per hour. Google pays $400, Amazon $380, and Facebook $350. How much will you receive in payment for this week? You worked 10 hours for Facebook, 6 hours for Google and 4 hours for Amazon.
Two different ways depending on situation (???)
function workPayment() {
	var googleHours = prompt("how many hours did you work at Google?");
	var amazonHours = prompt("how many hours did you work at Amazon?");
	var facbookHours = prompt("how many hours did you work at Facebook?");
	return ((googleHours * 400) + (amazonHours * 380) + (facbookHours * 350));
}


function totalPay(workplace, x) {
	const amount = prompt("How much do you make per hour?");
	if(workplace === "Google"){
		return (x * amount);
	} else if(workplace === "Amazon") {
		return (x * amount);
	} else return (x * amount);
}
