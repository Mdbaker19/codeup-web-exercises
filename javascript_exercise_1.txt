You have rented some movies for your kids: The little mermaid (for 3 days), Brother Bear (for 5 days, they love it), and Hercules (1 day, you don't know yet if they're going to like it). If price for a movie per day is $3, how much will you have to pay?
function sum(x, y) {
	return x + y;

}
function getTotal(array) {
	var newArray = array.map((element) => element *= 3);
	return newArray.reduce(sum);
}

//Different solution ??? which would work in a given situation???
function movieTotal(x, y, z) {
	return ((x * 3) + (y * 3) + (z * 3));
}

Suppose you're working as a contractor for 3 companies: Google, Amazon and Facebook, they pay you a different rate per hour. Google pays $400, Amazon $380, and Facebook $350. How much will you receive in payment for this week? You worked 10 hours for Facebook, 6 hours for Google and 4 hours for Amazon.
Two different ways depending on situation (???)
function workPayment() {
	var googleHours = prompt("how many hours did you work at Google?");
	var amazonHours = prompt("how many hours did you work at Amazon?");
	var facbookHours = prompt("how many hours did you work at Facebook?");
	return ((googleHours * 400) + (amazonHours * 380) + (facbookHours * 350));
}


function totalPay(workplace, x) {
	const amount = prompt("How much do you make per hour?");
	if(workplace === "Google"){
		return (x * amount);
	} else if(workplace === "Amazon") {
		return (x * amount);
	} else return (x * amount);
}
A student can be enrolled in a class only if the class is not full and the class schedule does not conflict with her current schedule.
function enroll(classStatus, classSchedule) {
	if(classStatus !== "full" && classSchedule !== "conflicts"){
		console.log("can enroll");
	} else console.log("cannot enroll");
}

A product offer can be applied only if a person buys more than 2 items,
and the offer has not expired. Premium members do not need to buy a specific amount of products

function offerAvailibilty(status, offer, amount){
	if(status === "Premium" && offer !== "expired"){
		console.log("product offer aplied");
	} else if(amount >= 2 && offer !== "expired"){
		console.log("product offer applied");
	} else console.log("buy more items or become a premium member");
}

var username = 'codeup';
var password = 'notastrongpassword';
Create a variable that holds a boolean value for each of the following conditions:

the password must be at least 5 characters
the password must not include the username
the username must be no more than 20 characters
neither the username or password can start or end with whitespace

May of not really done this right, at the time i did not know what it was asking

function checkQualityOfUnAndPass(username, password) {
	if(password.length < 5) {
		console.log("invalid password");
	} else console.log("password checked");
		if(password.includes(username) === true){
			console.log("invalid password");
		} else console.log("password checked");
			if(username.length < 20) {
				console.log("username checked")
			} else console.log("invalid username by length");
				if(username.charAt(0) === " " || password.charAt(0) === " "){
					console.log("invalid input, no space allowed");
				} else console.log("username and password checked");
}
