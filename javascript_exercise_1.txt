You have rented some movies for your kids: The little mermaid (for 3 days), Brother Bear (for 5 days, they love it), and Hercules (1 day, you don't know yet if they're going to like it). If price for a movie per day is $3, how much will you have to pay?
function sum(x, y) {
	return x + y;
}
function getTotal(array) {
	var newArray = array.map((element) => element *= 3);
	return newArray.reduce(sum);
}

//Different solution ??? which would work in a given situation???
function movieTotal(x, y, z) {
	return ((x * 3) + (y * 3) + (z * 3));
}
